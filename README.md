Sympto_Scan aims to address the global healthcare challenge of medical misdiagnosis, which has severe consequences for patients. In India alone, there are approximately 52 lakhs cases of medical negligence reported annually, with a 110% increase in recent years according to the National Library of Medicine. These alarming statistics highlight the urgent need for an accurate and reliable medical diagnosis system to prevent such misdiagnosis and ensure patient safety.
The project focuses on developing an effective and accurate symptom-based disease diagnosis system utilizing tree data structure. Sympto_Scan will prompt users to input their symptoms using an initial question set and follow-up questions. Upon completion, it will provide the user with the most likely diagnosis or a list of potential conditions, along with relevant information about each. The goal is to create an intuitive and accurate platform for self-assessment of medical symptoms, aiding users in seeking appropriate medical advice and treatment.
